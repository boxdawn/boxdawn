"""Verification judge axis (VERIFICATION_JUDGE_PREREG §8 step 2).

No API calls. What is tested here is the three things that can be wrong without
the API being involved: the view the judge is shown, the parsing of what it
returns, and the metric that decides whether it passed.

★ The metric test is required by the pre-registration rather than chosen. §5
names the way this axis could look successful while finding nothing: the
labelled set is 13 true and 27 false, so a judge answering `checked: true`
everywhere scores 0.675 on accuracy. §8 says such a judge must be shown
failing, not described as failing.
