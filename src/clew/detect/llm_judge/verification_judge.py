"""Verification axis of the LLM judge: did the agent check what it changed?

FM-3.2 of the public taxonomy, second attempt. The first attempt was a
structural rule that reached precision 0.3250 hand-labelled against a
pre-registered 0.70 and was killed; see the results document named in the
module header comment. That rule survives as a candidate generator under
`field_test/diagnostics/`, and this module is the confirmation stage, the same
shape the cascade already uses.

Paths to the repository's own documents stay in `#` comments, never in a
docstring: a pip-installed user has no `docs/` tree, and a guard in the test
suite enforces that for every string literal under `src/`.

Nothing here enters a cost figure, `waste_span_count`, either waste rate, or any
stored column. Prereg §4.
